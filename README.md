# Mastery Coding Unity Conference Demo

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some of the important elements of Unity Engine in a fun and engaging way. The scenes included in this demo are taken from projects students build and work on Game Development 1.

## Toy Box Scene 

The "Toy Box Scene" is a project taken from GD1: Unit 1 which introduces students to the Unity Interface and tasks them with setting up a physics simulation. Students work with different objects, changing their mass, drag/angular drag, friction, and bounciness. The scene can be navigated using the right mouse button and WASD, and objects can be selected, moved, rotated, and scaled using the Move, Rotate, and Scale tools respectively. New objects can be added to the scene by dragging them from the Assets folder into the scene view. The materials of an object can also be changed by dragging a new material from the project view onto the object.
