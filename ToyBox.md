# Toy Box Scene

This scene is taken from GD1: Unit 1. This project introduces students to the Unity Interface and tasks them with setting up a physics simulation. To successfully set up the simulation students work with a variety of different objects, changing the mass, drag/angular drag, friction, and bounciness of each object. 

## Navigating the Scene View

To move the Scene View Camera hold down the right mouse button and move around using WASD. You can also rotate the camera using the mouse.

## Moving, Rotating, Scaling Objects
