# Toy Box Scene

This scene is taken from GD1: Unit 1. This project introduces students to the Unity Interface and tasks them with setting up a physics simulation. To successfully set up the simulation students work with a variety of different objects, changing the mass, drag/angular drag, friction, and bounciness of each object.

## Moving, Rotating, Scaling Objects

To select an object left click on it in the Scene View. Once you've selected an object you can change its position, rotation, and scale by using the Move, Rotate, and Scale tools respectively. The keyboard shortcuts below will allow you to easily switch between the different tools:

* W - Move Tool
* E - Rotate Tool
* R - Scale Tool
